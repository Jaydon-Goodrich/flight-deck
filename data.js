        'As an early holiday gift, Flight-Deck Avionics delivered this Cessna TU206G (shown below) to a Utah law enforcement agency.  A custom pilots instrument panel was designed, CNC fabricated, and finished in Citation grey.  The Garmin G500 Retrofit PFD/MFD system was added, along with a GNS430W WAAS-GPS/NAV/COM and GTX330 Mode S Transponder with Traffic Info Service (TIS).  Instrument panel lighting was updated on the pilot side.  To meet the departments budget, the existing copilot instrument panel overlay was painted to match with great results.',

      'To bring in the new year, Flight-Deck Avionics has delivered another great cockpit, the V35 Bonanza (shown below) .  This project began with the idea of improving on existing Bonanza EFIS installations, completed by other shops around the country.  The Flight-Deck redesigned, CNC fabricated instrument panel incorporates a single piece construction, with an integral chart compartment, eliminating the common 4-peice design, and cardboard chart box.  The additional avionics suite includes a Garmin G500 Retrofit PFD/MFD EFIS System, and the new JP Instruments EDM730 Engine Data Monitor System.  All instrument lighting was updated, eliminating the original post-lamps.  The resulting layout provides a flowing, intuitive instrument scan, reducing pilot workload.'

      'This Cessna 172 (shown below) was retrofitted this month with a Garmin GMA340 Audio Panel with 4-Place Intercom, dual GNS430W WAA-GPS NAV/COMs, GTX330 Mode S Transponder with Traffic Information Service (TIS), and G500 Primary PFD/MFD system.  New Flight-Deck Avionics designed instrument panels were installed in Citation Grey.  An updated instrument lighting package with a reupholstered glare-shield keeps everything visible.  The original red plastic trim on both the lower sub-panel, and control pedestal was replaced with new trim, in flat black.  The control wheels were updated, incorporating integral transmitter switches.  This 172 has transformed into a great IFR training platform, with room for future avionics expansion.'
